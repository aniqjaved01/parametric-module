# Parametric 3D Module

## Description of Project

This is a parametric 3D module configuration application built with React, TypeScript, and Three.js. The application allows users to configure module parameters (width, height, and finish) and visualize a 3D representation of the module in real-time. It also automatically calculates and displays a Bill of Materials (BOM) based on the selected parameters, matching parts from a product catalog.
